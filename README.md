# Measuring Assessment Improvement Under Measurement Error
Welcome. As a part of our internal evaluation of the assessments used locally by City Year Los Angeles, we sought to understand the impact of the measurement error baked into the assessment on our attempts to measure improvement for single students, individual schools, and the program overall.  

There are two papers which have been prepared:

  1. Measurement Error in the MI and RI
     * Explains what SEM is and begins to describe how it impacts single measurements and then our site overall.
  2. Measuring Improvement Under Uncertainty
     * Uses Monte Carlo sampling to further explore the implciations of SEM on measuring student improvement.
